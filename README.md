# Kojo Lib

Kojo-Lib provides [Kojo](https://www.kojo.in) (the Scala based learning environment) as a library that you can use with:
- [Scala 3](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib-scala3samples) or Scala 2.13.x, and any Scala IDE (Intellij IDEA, Visual Studio Code + Metals, etc).
- Any JVM language (that is able to consume Java jar files).

## Quick Start using scala-cli

* Check that you have `scala-cli` in terminal. If you install latest `scala` from https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ via (Coursier) `cs setup` you will also get `scala-cli`. You can also install `scala-cli` separately from https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/

* Download this file: https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/releases/download/v0.3.1/kojo-english.scala

* Start the Scala REPL in the same dir as the above file with this command:
```
scala-cli repl .
```

* Type `forward()` by the `scala>` prompt:
```
Welcome to Scala 3.1.2 (17.0.2, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> forward()
``` 

* You should now see the Kojo turtle draw a red line in a new window.

* For further information see [here](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/tree/main/getting-started), including how to get Kojo started with a specific local language.


## Quick Start using sbt

* Check that you have `sbt` in terminal.  If you install latest `scala` from https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ via `cs setup` you will also get `sbt`. You can also install `sbt` separately from https://www.scala-sbt.org/

* Add the following dependency in your `build.sbt` file:
```
val kojoLibVersion = "0.3.1"
libraryDependencies += "net.kogics" % "kojo-lib" % kojoLibVersion from 
  s"https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/releases/download/v$kojoLibVersion/kojo-lib-assembly-$kojoLibVersion.jar"
```

* Start `sbt` and type `console` inside sbt to start the Scala REPL

* Type `forward()` by the `scala>` prompt:
```
Welcome to Scala 3.1.2 (17.0.2, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> forward()
``` 

* You should now see the Kojo turtle draw a red line i a new window.

* For further information see [here](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/tree/main/getting-started), including how to get Kojo started with a specific local language.




## Doing a manual build (for any JVM language)
- Clone this repo.
- Go into the repo dir in a terminal.
- run `./sbt.sh buildDist` to get the `dist` and `dist-scala` dirs (explained below).
- run `./sbt.sh assembly` to get a fat kojo-lib-assembly-x.y.z.jar in target/scala-2.13

This will give you two folders of interest:
- `dist` - which contains jars that you can use (on the classpath) with any JVM language. *Note* - you can also use the latest kojo-lib-assembly-x.y.z.jar release jar in place of these jars. 
- `dist-scala` - which contains a couple of Scala jars that you need to include in your classpath for any language other than Scala.

### Minimal sample client programs
- [In Scala 3](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib-scala3samples/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/Main.scala)
- [In Scala 2.13.x](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/driver/Main.scala)
- [In Java](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/java/driver/Main4Java.java)

### Examples (mostly from the Kojo Showcase menu)
- [Inner Eye](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/InnerEye.scala)
- [Mandelbrot Set](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/MandelbrotSet.scala)
- [Car Ride](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/CarRide.scala)
- [Platformer Game](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/DemoPlatformer.scala)
- [Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/example/TicTacToeUnbeatable.scala)  
- [Othello](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/blob/main/src/main/scala/game/othello/main.scala)
- [And more...](https://github.com/litan/kojo-lib/tree/main/src/main/scala/example)
